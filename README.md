### ⭓ Project Architecture

### Feature-Based Modular Architecture

Feature-Based Modular Architecture organizes an app into independent modules based on features, each containing its own screens and logic. Shared resources like components, API configurations, and constants are placed in dedicated folders. This structure promotes maintainability, scalability, and code reusability.
